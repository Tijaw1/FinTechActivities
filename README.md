# Case Study: Betterment

## Overview

Betterment is a robo-advisor company that was founded in 2008 by Jon Stein and Eli Broverman. This company provides a product that allows individuals to auto-invest their money based on their financial goals and track their investment portfolio. They also recently added checking and savings accounts as services. 

One of their direct competitors is Wealthfront, which offers a similar line of products and charges a similar fee.

Betterment quantifies the customerâ€™s risk tolerance attribute in the computation of the optimized portfolio that is specific to the customer. It also uses some technique to reduce the tax related to the income.
