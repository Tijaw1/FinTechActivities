# Case Study: Betterment

## Overview

Betterment is one of the original robo-advisors, first launched in 2008 with a mission to democratize the expensive, complicated business of investing. More than a decade later, Betterment remains among the most popular robo-advisor platforms, competing directly with Wealthfront at the head of a growing crowd of automated investing options.

Betterment has bulked up its platform with a range of features and tools over the years, delivering a sophisticated and highly functional product to its clients. But for some users who are just getting started with investing, all the bells and whistles might seem somewhat overwhelming.

### Betterment Pros
Low advisory fees
Ability to choose different portfolios for different goals
Tax management features, including tax-loss harvesting
