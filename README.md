# Case Study: Betterment

## Overview

Betterment is one of the original robo-advisors, first launched in 2008 with a mission to democratize the expensive, complicated business of investing. More than a decade later, Betterment remains among the most popular robo-advisor platforms, competing directly with Wealthfront at the head of a growing crowd of automated investing options.

Betterment has bulked up its platform with a range of features and tools over the years, delivering a sophisticated and highly functional product to its clients. But for some users who are just getting started with investing, all the bells and whistles might seem somewhat overwhelming.

### Betterment Pros
Low advisory fees

Ability to choose different portfolios for different goals

Tax management features, including tax-loss harvesting

### Betterment Cons
Relatively high fees for professional advice

Emergency fund portfolio could be too risky

Betterment is a solid robo-advisor choice for people who want to get serious about investing for something big, like a home down payment, college fund or their own retirement. Betterment’s algorithms match your risk tolerance and specific goals to diversified portfolios of low-cost exchange traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. Unlike Wealthfront, Betterment has no minimum deposit required to get started.

Betterment offers two service tiers: Betterment Digital and Betterment Premium, available as an option for customers with a balance of more than $100,000. Betterment Digital charges an annual management fee of 0.25%, while Betterment Premium charges 0.40%. Opting into the higher service tier gets you unlimited, free services from Betterment’s team of financial advisors.
