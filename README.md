This company provides a product that allows individuals to auto-invest their money based on their financial goals and track their investment portfolio. They also recently added checking and savings accounts as services. 

One of their direct competitors is Wealthfront, which offers a similar line of products and charges a similar fee. WiseBanyan is also another competitor that offers goal-based investing.

## Technologies Used

Betterment’s use of RoboAdvising entails autonomous generation of investment portfolio advice through computer-based algorithms. The RoboAdvice software quantifies the customer’s level of risk tolerance, which then allows Betterment to apply theories of quantitative finance, such as the Black-Litterman model, in it’s financial advice. This usage of quantitative financial theory sets Betterment apart from traditional wealth management companies. Additionally, as with most consumer-oriented financial services, Betterment has its own apps for various platforms.
